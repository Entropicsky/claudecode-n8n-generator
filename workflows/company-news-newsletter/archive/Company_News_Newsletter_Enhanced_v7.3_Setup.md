This sheet should have two tabs:
1. **List** - Contains company names in a column named "company" (or "Company")
2. **Recipients** - Contains email addresses in a column named "email" (or "Email")

If your sheet has a different ID:
- Open both "Read Company List" and "Read Email Recipients" nodes

- **Google Sheets account**: For reading/writing spreadsheets
- **Gmail account**: For sending emails
- **OpenAI account**: For AI processing (GPT-4o)
- **Perplexity account**: For research (sonar-pro model)

### Step 4: Test the Workflow
1. Add a few test companies to your List sheet
2. Add test email recipients to your Recipients sheet
3. Run the workflow manually using the Manual Trigger
4. The workflow will:
   - Create a new Research Database
   - Research each company with bullet-point format

- Clear section headers in bold
- Structured lists for easy scanning
- Consistent spacing and indentation
- Professional color scheme

## Troubleshooting

### Bullet points not displaying correctly
- The workflow converts markdown formatting to HTML
- Check that the AI Agents are using the bullet character (â€¢)
- Verify the Format Email node's HTML conversion function

### Recipients not found
- Ensure the Recipients sheet has an "email" or "Email" column
- Check that email addresses are valid
- Remove any empty rows in the Recipients sheet

### Company research too verbose
- The AI Agent system prompts enforce bullet point format
- If needed, adjust the maxTokens parameter in the Research LLM node

## Best Practices
1. **Keep recipient list updated** - Add/remove emails from Recipients sheet as needed
2. **Test formatting** - Run with 2-3 companies first to verify bullet point formatting
3. **Monitor length** - Bullet points should be concise (one key point each)
4. **Regular schedule** - Weekly runs provide best tracking
