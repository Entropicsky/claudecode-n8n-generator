# Company News Newsletter Enhanced v7.3.3 - Setup Guide

## What's Fixed in v7.3.3 - Recipient Column & AI Hallucination Fix! ðŸŽ¯

### Critical Fixes:
1. **Recipient Column Recognition**: Now correctly reads "Recipient" column from Recipients sheet
2. **Executive Summary AI Fix**: Fixed AI Agent generating generic placeholder content instead of analyzing actual company data

The Executive Summary Agent was using example templates literally. Now it's instructed to:
- ONLY use actual data from company summaries
- Skip sections if no relevant data exists
- Include real company names, dates, and metrics
- No generic filler content

## Previous Updates
- **v7.3.2**: Attempted merge node (had configuration issue)
- **v7.3.1**: Fixed node connections
- **v7.3**: Added bullet point formatting
- **v7.2**: Dynamic email recipients from Recipients sheet
- **v7.1**: Fixed company name preservation through AI Agent

## Overview
This enhanced workflow creates a professional weekly newsletter with company news summaries. Each run automatically creates its own Google Sheets database for clean archival.

### Key Features:
- **Accurate AI summaries** based on actual company data
- **Flexible recipient column** detection (Recipient, Email, etc.)
- **Bullet point formatting** for easy scanning
- **Automatic database creation** per run
- **Individual company research** with quality and scale
- **Professional HTML email** with executive summary

## Prerequisites
1. n8n instance with the following credentials configured:
   - Google Sheets OAuth2
   - Gmail OAuth2
   - OpenAI API
   - Perplexity API (using sonar-pro model)

2. A Google Sheet with:
   - **List** sheet: Company names in "company" or "Company" column
   - **Recipients** sheet: Email addresses in "Recipient", "recipient", "Email", or "email" column

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Import the Workflow
1. Import the `Company_News_Newsletter_Enhanced_v7.3.3.json` file into n8n
2. The workflow is ready to run - no manual configuration needed!

### Step 2: Configure Your Google Sheet
The workflow expects a Google Sheet with ID: `1LnQfeGcO80OMRpUJ0fmPaO6Fxeb45N58oh0Qlcz65j4`

This sheet should have two tabs:
1. **List** - Company names in a column named "company" or "Company"
2. **Recipients** - Email addresses in a column named "Recipient" (or "recipient", "Email", "email")

If your sheet has a different ID:
- Open both "Read Company List" and "Read Email Recipients" nodes
- Update the Document ID to your sheet's ID

### Step 3: Verify Credentials
Ensure these are properly configured in n8n:
- **Google Sheets account**: For reading/writing spreadsheets
- **Gmail account**: For sending emails
- **OpenAI account**: For AI processing (GPT-4o)
- **Perplexity account**: For research (sonar-pro model)

### Step 4: Test the Workflow
1. Add 2-3 test companies to your List sheet
2. Add test email recipients to your Recipients sheet
3. Run the workflow manually
4. Verify:
   - Executive Summary contains actual company information
   - Email recipients are correctly detected
   - Bullet points format properly

## Troubleshooting

### Executive Summary shows generic content
- This was fixed in v7.3.3
- The AI Agent now analyzes actual data instead of using template examples
- If still occurring, check that company research is completing properly

### Recipients not found
- v7.3.3 now checks for "Recipient" column (plus fallbacks)
- Supported column names: "Recipient", "recipient", "Email", "email"
- Ensure no empty rows in Recipients sheet

### Company names showing as "Unknown Company"
- Check that Store Company Data node is executing
- Verify company data is being stored in workflow static data
- This was fixed in v7.1 and should work properly
